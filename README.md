Just Search is an Assist replacement (the app that launches after long pressing home). 
It provides a simple way to search from everywhere without needing to launch the heavy (in terms of data and resources' needs) Google search app.
Just Search uses DuckDuckGo by default, but allows opting for Qwant, Google, Bing, Yandex or Yahoo instead.
